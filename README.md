# Dead Man's Switch in Python 3 to Encrypt & Delete Files Whenever A User Doesn't Check In

In cybersecurity, understanding a dead man's switch is a fairly simple concept. If one doesn't perform a specific task before a set amount of time, it'll perform a specific action you set. They can be handy not just for hackers but for everyone who wants to protect themselves, someone else, or something tangible or intangible from harm. While there are more nefarious uses for a dead man's switch, white hats can put one to good use.

These switches have appeared in pop culture in many different forms, and examples can be seen in films such as "Point Break" "Speed," and "Crimson Tide." For a more recent example, in the film "Tenet," Sator (the antagonist) had implemented a dead man's switch to go off whenever his heart stopped, which would activate the algorithm that would end the entire world.

Notorious whistleblower Edward Snowden even used one in real life when he leaked all of those sensitive NSA documents to journalists. He sent encrypted versions to people he could trust who would receive the decryption key if he were to die under mysterious or violent circumstances.


## When a Dead Man's Switch Comes in Handy

From a white hat hacker's perspective, a dead man's switch is useful for locking things down. The switch could also be used to keep some sensitive files locked down before anyone has a chance to access them. If you don't perform a specific action that you set for yourself, either once or in intervals, then the files you selected would be encrypted so that nobody could read them.


### Building a Simple Dead Man's Switch in Python 3

Python 3 and a Python 3 integrated development environment (IDE) is all one really needs to build one. Pycharm will be the IDE choice for making the application.
